This is a backwards-compatible dependency update release. The updated
dependency versions are all bugfix and feature releases, no major version
changes. The dependencies are being updated in order to ensure that critical
bug fixes in e.g. the pe_build plugin are included when validating oscar's
dependencies.

  * Update vagrant-hosts dependency to 2.6.1
  * Update vagrant-pe_build dependency to 0.13.6
  * Update vagrant-auto_network dependency to 1.0.2
